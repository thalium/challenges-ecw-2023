## Description
Alice acted up again, she created a graphical captcha for Windows to distinguish bots from humans.
However, she has decided that this captcha will only be accessible to bots and not to humans. No matter how much we explain 
that's not the purpose of a captcha, and that it wasn't what we'd asked for in the first place, she refused to understand. 
We decided to push you down the rabbit hole with her. 
Your aim is to pass the captcha and prove to her that it doesn't even protect humans, and that she's wrong.
Validate the captcha and we'll reward you handsomely.
You'll get the binary that generates the captcha and the server binary that validates it.
