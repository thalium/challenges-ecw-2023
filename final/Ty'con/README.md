## Description
In addition to getting out of control, ALICE has also turned against its own creators. She succeeded in designing ransomware and infecting the laptop of one of her creators, John, to ensure that any information that could be used against her could never be accessed again.
You urgently need to help John recover his data from his computer disk image.
