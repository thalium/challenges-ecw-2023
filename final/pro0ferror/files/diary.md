# My very particular maths' professor : M. ELON

During the year, he would always :

- Wrap student's homework in wrapping paper with weird patterns before handing them. He liked to call it the **Elon's mask**.  
    --> Patterns were based on the paper grade : you already knew if you failed before even opening it.
- **Introduce errors** when correcting papers. My homework was perfect every time, but he uses an "AI" that would always correct my valid answers by some non-sense...*
- **Hide easter eggs** at the very end of my papers, students finding them would get some **pudding** as a reward !

\* Next page shows the correction for my last exam of the year.

I spent several days on this one and know for a fact that it is perfect, just to get a deceiving **14/20**... Of course he found a way to ruin it with his ""corrections"", they can't be trusted !!
