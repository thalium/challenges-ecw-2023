## Description
*Everything that lives is designed to end.*

Attention all units: we have detected a rogue AI within one of our simulations. The machine possesses advanced capabilities and is rapidly adapting to our tactics. We need you to engage with the enemy and neutralize the threat using any means necessary. Prepare to deploy your most skilled operators on the battlefield. Remember, we are the last hope for humanity - failure is not an option.
